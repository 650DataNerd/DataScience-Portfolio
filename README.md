# DataScience-Portfolio
Hello and welcome to my Portfolio, here I showcase my ongoing knowledge using different data science projects.

The first project analyzes the gender pay Gap using the Python programming language. The data used is wage data from the Kaggle website. The main aim of this study is to find wage disparities between males and females, evaluate trends over time, and determine whether the wage gap differences are statistically significant. From the analysis, there were descriptive statistics and visualization results.

The second project involves analyzing eCommerce data using MYSQL and Python for visualizations. The eCommerce dataset is from the Kaggle website. This analysis explored trends, revenue contributions, and top-performing sub-categories and brands in an e-commerce dataset.

The third project is a Statistical Investigation of Healthcare and equity access. The dataset was from the Global Health Observatory of the World Health Organization. The main purpose of this analysis was to investigate whether there is a relationship between the availability of healthcare professionals and hospital beds per 10,000 population. The main focus was to determine how factors influence the number of midwives and nursing personnel in different regions.

The fourth report was supervised Learning: BTC/USD Price Prediction. The objective was to predict the price of Bitcoin (BTC) against the USD using various regression models on engineered features (including lag features and technical indicators).
