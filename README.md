# DataScience-Portfolio
Hello and welcome to my Portfolio, here I showcase my ongoing knowledge using different data science projects.
The first project analyzes the gender pay Gap using the Python programming language. The data used is wage data from the Kaggle website. The main aim of this study is to find wage disparities between males and females, evaluate trends over time, and determine whether the wage gap differences are statistically significant.                      From the analysis, there were descriptive statistics and visualization results.
